# EnergyGuard

EnergyGuard is a new energy-saving application, designed for Windows 11 and built in partnership with Intel and UCL. The app allows users to monitor their device's energy usage and utilises the hybrid architecture in Intel's latest processors to help users save power. Please note, this application requires administrator privileges to access power data from the hardware. For the app to provide accurate data, the launch on startup setting also needs to be enabled.

## Requirements

Energy monitoring is available to all users with Windows 11 and Windows 10 (Build 17763 or above) users.

To gain access to energy-saving features, an i5 or above, 12th or 13th gen processor is required, with at least 4 E-cores and 2 P-cores.
